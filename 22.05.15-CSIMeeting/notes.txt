Rationale for mixture ChIPscore:

- As the direct binding occurs within the protein complex
- Within the complex, many other proteins may associate with lower signal intensities

Peak functional annotation:

- Classical: assign peak to its closest gene
- This method: assign peak to its closest promoter and clusters the peaks in close proximity to the same gene

- Title: ChIPseq signal
- ChIPseq digram with DNA!
- Mixture chromatin, plot direct and indirect and mixture add with real gaussian
- Remove pdf on mixture model
- ChIPseq signals
- Input in the flow chart is a BAM
- Change the colour from blue -> white
- MACS and jahmm 2 author references
- Explain why two different peak callers (say something about the peak scores and bias of the called peaks)
- Take-home: MACS2 able to find the peak, however the estimated scores are less fit than jahmm
- Summary slide for component calls, add figure fitted with 3 components
- Centdist explains -> with reference from authors
- Centdist shows only the top 3 with the components fitted in the ChIPseq
- Component2 -> started to see ETS family members
- Mix model filter out component 1
