Rationale for mixture ChIPscore:

- As the direct binding occurs within the protein complex
- Within the complex, many other proteins may associate with lower signal intensities

Peak functional annotation:

- Classical: assign peak to its closest gene
- This method: assign peak to its closest promoter and clusters the peaks in close proximity to the same gene
